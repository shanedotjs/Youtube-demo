# YouTube Demo

YouTube Demo is a basic static webpage created with HTML and CSS. It's a simple replica of YouTube's homepage and was designed as a learning project to grasp fundamental HTML and CSS concepts, including Flexbox and CSS Grid.

This project is a great starting point for beginners looking to explore web development and responsive design. It was created while I was learning from a SuperSimpleDev's video on basic HTML and CSS.

Feel free to fork, clone, or modify it for your own learning purposes.

Enjoy exploring the world of web development with YouTube Demo!
